            <h2>ðŸŽ¬ Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                I have been devoting to Software Engineering since I was 10 â€” when I started reading my sister's
                university books ðŸ“š â€”
                and I left school aged 16 to move to Edinburgh, looking for a new challenge.
                I started my career early to grow in various positions:
                I take a generalist approach and am always enthusiastic to learn new skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                A minimalist at heart, I find my sweet spot when disentangling complex technical puzzles to find simple
                solutions for my customers.
            </p>
            <p>
                I now have almost 10 years of working experience, from hands-on Software Architecture, to Developer
                Advocacy,
                to Site Reliability Engineering and collaboration in Open Source.
            </p>
